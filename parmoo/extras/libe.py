Use the libE_MOOP class to define and solve multiobjective optimization
problems (MOOPs) with parallel simulation evaluations. The libE_MOOP class
extends the base class parmoo.moop.MOOP for defining and solving MOOPs.

The parmoo_persis_gen function can be used as a generator function in
libEnsemble. To do so, create a regular `parmoo.MOOP` object and add it to
the `gen_specs` dict, then import and use `parmoo_persis_gen` as the libE

class libE_MOOP(MOOP):
    """ Class for solving a MOOP using libEnsemble to manage parallelism.

    Upon initialization, supply a scalar optimization procedure and
    dictionary of hyperparameters using the default constructor:
     * ``moop = libE_MOOP.__init__(ScalarOpt, [hyperparams={}])``

    Class methods are summarized below.

    To define the MOOP, add each design variable, simulation, objective, and
    constraint (in that order) by using the following functions:
     * ``libE_MOOP.addDesign(*args)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.addSimulation(*args)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.addObjective(*args)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.addConstraint(*args)``

    Next, define your solver.

    Acquisition functions (used for scalarizing problems/setting targets) are
    added using:
     * ``libE_MOOP.addAcquisition(*args)``

    After creating a MOOP, the following methods may be useful for getting
    the numpy.dtype of the input/output arrays:
     * ``libE_MOOP.getDesignType()``
     * ``libE_MOOP.getSimulationType()``
     * ``libE_MOOP.getObjectiveType()``
     * ``libE_MOOP.getConstraintType()``

    The following methods are used to save/load ParMOO objects from memory:
     * ``libE_MOOP.save([filename="parmoo"])``
     * ``libE_MOOP.load([filename="parmoo"])``

    To turn on checkpointing (recommended), use:
     * ``libE_MOOP.setCheckpoint(checkpoint, [checkpoint_data, filename])``

    ParMOO's logging feature is not active for the `libE_MOOP` class
    since libEnsemble already provides this feature.

    After defining the MOOP and setting up checkpointing and logging,
    use the following method to solve the MOOP (using libEnsemble
    to distribute simulation evaluations):
     * ``libE_MOOP.solve(iter_max=None, sim_max=None, wt_max=864000,
                         profile=False)``

    The following methods are used for managing ParMOO's internal
    simulation/objective databases. Note that these databases are
    maintained separately from libEnsemble's simulation database:
     * ``libE_MOOP.check_sim_db(x, s_name)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.update_sim_db(x, sx, s_name)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.evaluateSimulation(x, s_name)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.addData(x, sx)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.iterate(k, ib)``
     * ``libE_MOOP.updateAll(k, batch)``

    Finally, the following methods are used to retrieve data after the
    problem has been solved:
     * ``libE_MOOP.getPF(format='ndarray')``
     * ``libE_MOOP.getSimulationData(format='ndarray')``
     * ``libE_MOOP.getObjectiveData(format='ndarray')``

    Other private methods from the MOOP class do not work for a libE_MOOP.
