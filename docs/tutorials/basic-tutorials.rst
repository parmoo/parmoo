Basic Tutorials
===============

This is a collection of all tutorials demonstrating basic ParMOO functionality
(collected from throughout the ParMOO User Guide).

.. _quickstart_ex:

Quickstart Demo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a basic example (see `quickstart.py <https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo/blob/main/examples/quickstart.py>`_) of how to build and solve a MOOP with ParMOO,
taken from the :doc:`Quickstart <../quickstart>` guide.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.py
    :language: python

The above code saves all (approximate) Pareto optimal solutions in the
``results`` dataframe, and prints the ``results`` dataframe to the standard
output:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/quickstart.out

And produces the following figure of the Pareto points:

Named Output Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following `named_var_ex.py <https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo/blob/main/examples/named_var_ex.py>`_ code demonstrates ParMOO's output datatype when the
:mod:`MOOP <moop.MOOP>` object is defined using *named* variables.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/named_var_ex.py
    :language: python

The above code produces the following output.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/named_var_ex.out

Unnamed Output Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following `unnamed_var_ex.py <https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo/blob/main/examples/unnamed_var_ex.py>`_ code demonstrates ParMOO's output datatype when the
:mod:`MOOP <moop.MOOP>` object is defined using *unnamed* variables.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/unnamed_var_ex.py
    :language: python

The above code produces the following output.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/unnamed_var_ex.out

Adding Precomputed Simulation Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following `precomputed_data.py <https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo/blob/main/examples/precomputed_data.py>`_ code demonstrates how to add a precomputed simulation output
to ParMOO's internal simulation databases.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/precomputed_data.py
    :language: python

The above code produces the following output.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/precomputed_data.out

Logging and Checkpointing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When solving a large or expensive problem, logging and checkpointing
are recommended.
The following code snippet shows how to solve the same problem from
the `Quickstart example <quickstart_ex>`_, but with logging and checkpointing
turned on.
Then, another MOOP is created by reloading from the checkpoint file,
and run for 1 extra iteration, in order to demonstrate how to reload
from a saved checkpoint file.

Note how the lambda functions from `Quickstart example <quickstart_ex>`_
have been explicitly defined below.
This is because ParMOO reloads functions by name, which means that it
does not support checkpointing for lambda functions and any named function
must be defined with the same name in the global scope during reloading.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/checkpointing.py
    :language: python

The above `checkpointing.py <https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo/blob/main/examples/checkpointing.py>`_ code produces the following output.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/checkpointing.out

.. _advanced_ex:

Solving a MOOP with Derivative-Based Solvers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to minimize two conflicting quadratic functions
of three variables (named ``x1``, ``x2``, and ``x3``),
under the constraint that an additional categorical variable (``x4``)
must be fixed in class ``0`` :math:`^*`,
using the derivative-based solver :mod:`LBFGSB <optimizers.lbfgsb.LBFGSB>`.

:math:`^*` No, this constraint does not really affect the solution;
it is just here to demonstrate how constraints/categorical variables
are handled by derivative-based solvers.
ParMOO does not use derivative information associated with
any categorical variables, so the derivative w.r.t. ``x4`` can be set
to any value, without affecting the outcome.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/advanced_ex.py
    :language: python

The above `advanced_ex.py <https://github.com/parmoo/parmoo/blob/main/examples/advanced_ex.py>`_ code produces the following output.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/advanced_ex.out

Note how in the full simulation database several of the design points
violate the constraint (``x4 != 0``).
But in the solution, the constraint is always satisfied.
